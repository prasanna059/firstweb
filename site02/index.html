<h3> An online class is a course conducted over the Internet. They are generally conducted through a learning management system, in which students can view their course syllabus and academic progress, as well as communicate with fellow students and their course instructor.

Online classes are generally self-paced, allowing for greater flexibility in completing coursework. Some examples of online courses are MOOCs, or Massive Open Online Courses, as produced by organizations such as edX or Coursera. Many traditional universities offer online courses, including Purdue University via their takeover of Kaplan.
